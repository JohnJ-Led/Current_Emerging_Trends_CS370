# Current_Emerging_Trends_CS370

* Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
    * TreasureMaze.py acts as the game environment. Building the maze array thats passed to it and returing a reward based on agent movement.
    * GameExperience.py holds our experience replay cold, stores historical eqpisodes, and contains the code for updating and maximizing our rewards in a Q-Table
    * Ledbetter_John_ProjectTwo.ipynb contains verious functions for testing our game completion, building and updating out model/neural network and the Q-Learning Algorithm
      * The qtrain function and more specifically the q-learning algorithm is what I have worked on completing.
* Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
    * What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
      * Magic - Magic grows the imagination and wonder of the world.
      * Computer scientist take real world problems and work to create digital solutions. Such solutions can help to advanced the world, such as reducing car accidents with self driving cars
    * How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
      * (Working on My Own) After looking at a problem, I will thinking of various possible solution. Research the problem space and solution. See if other solutions already exist and begin from there.
    * What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
      * My simplified view. To protect both.
      * Use only user data that permission has been given for.
      * Don't share information that can be personally idenifiable to a specifc user. (PII)
      * When working with data that can be ethically questionable, work with a diverse group of peers to properly identify those areas and fix.
